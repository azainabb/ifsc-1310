  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I collected feedback from a few friends in this class and my brothers on my first attempt at the Dragon project. For the overall structure of the project, none of the 5 people I asked had anything negative to say about it. They loved the color scheme and how I implemented different shades of purple. They liked how I kept the general homepage pretty clean and moved the contact form into its own section with nothing other than the contact information. A lot of my classmates pointed out the SpaceX logo on my website and liked how I changed it to an all black logo.</p>
 <p>The one negative thing that a few of my peers had to say about this assignment was how the text and images were very repetitive. In order to fix the repetitive feel the site gave off, I went in and searched multiple images and replaced them so the site had a variety of information and images to share. If I were to start over, I would keep the repetitiveness in mind. </p>
 <p>In order to add js in some way to the project I took the area where the large image at the bottom of each page is, and used what was learned in the cycle lab to make a sort of slideshow-type transition on the website only on the contact page. </p>
 <p>At last, I genuinely enjoyed this class and my time doing each project throughout the semester. Iâ€™m not experienced at all in coding or computer science and this class introduced me to it. As a Professor you're very kind, lenient, and made the class very interactive and enjoyable. I liked the class being very project oriented, it allowed me to ease into this new environment and learn easier. Thank you for this semester and have a nice holiday! P.S. This class was my favorite class this semester :)</p>
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>It's a philosophy in which content is emphasized and additional features are layered. Progressive enhancement is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first. Progressive enhancement is important to modern web development so modern browsers can run all required code on all browsers. It allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page.</p>
