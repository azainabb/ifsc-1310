  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>In this assignment I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, I'd like you to attempt to address any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users. You should provide a link to the revised project (duplicate the directory in aws and then add a link to the revised project (see above). You should also provide several paragraphs reflecting on the learning experience working on this project and your experience during the semester. What were the things you did well? What would you do differently if you had to startover? Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes.</p>
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>It's a philosophy in which content is emphasized and additional features are layered. Progressive enhancement is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first. Progressive enhancement is important to modern web development so modern browsers can run all required code on all browsers. It allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page.</p>
